In this challenge, you have to build a predictive model using whichever open source statistical / machine learning libraries in Python that you are familiar with. 

The accompanying file, ``challenge_data.csv`` contains a CSV file with 1000 rows of data and 12 columns. It can be easily loaded into a numpy array or a pandas DataFrame. 

* First row is the header (column names)
* First column (`index`) is the row sequence number.
* Last column, (`target`) is the numerical variable you want to predict.
* The other columns, `feature_1` to `feature_10` are numerical feature values you'll want to use in your predictive model.

Send us the Python code you use to build and evaluate your model and a short explanation of your decision process (For example, did you use all the features, or some of them?). A jupyter notebook containing both is also fine :)
